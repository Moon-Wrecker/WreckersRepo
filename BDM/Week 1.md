# Micro and Macro Economics: The role of Data

## Consumption and Demand

Economic Activity:

+ Distributuion
+ Excahange
+ Production
+ Consumption
+ Investment

Micro is the study of individual, Macro is the study of group (aggregate).

Marco :

+ GDP
+ Government
+ Industry

Prices are both Macro and Micro
(inflation is Macro part of price)

For Both Micro and Macro we need DATA.

## Production, Consumption and exchange

### Production

Micro concepts: Production and Consumptions

Production is the process of value addition. Any process where there is a value addition is a Production.
Production is the process of converting raw material into useful utility value in the process of production.

Goods/Services become usefulas they acquire utility value in the process of production.

Should we produce computer chips or potato chips?

Price Data:
With the give prices of inputs they choose sunch combinations which minimise cost of produnction so that they earn maximum profit.
Invisible hand: Price determining (price determining mechanism)

### Consumption

+ Consumption is that economic activity which is concerned with the use of goods and servives for the direct satisfaction of the individuals and collective wants.
+ A consumer is a person who consumes goods and services for the satisfaction of his/her wants.
+ Consumption activity is the abse of all production activitties.
+ There would not be production if there was no consumption

#### Consumption theory

+ As a consumer people have limited means (income) while their wants are unlimited.
+ Study of consumption behaviour is concerned with the question "How people use their given/limited means for the purchase of different goods and services, so that their satisfaction is maximised?"
+ In consumption theory we formulate a set fo standard relationships explaining how consumers tend to behave.

### Exchange

+ Exchange is that activity which is concerned with sale and purchase of commodities.
+ In simple terms barter or buying and selling

## Consumption Basket 

What is the pattern of consumption between different consumptions?
We need large scale data to inference pattern: large scale surveys gives details about the economy.

## Survey Data

National Sample Survey
